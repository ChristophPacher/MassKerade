Prototype for an interactive mediafacade with top down kinect people tracking and gesture recognition

This code is not clean or perfectly documented. 
The tracker is not standalone. It should be separted from the game via a nice network interface. One of many Todos, like finishing the intergration of the Kinect V2. 
If you need help setting up the external libs, contact me.
