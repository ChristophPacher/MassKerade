# MassKerade
Prototype for an interactive mediafacade with top down kinect people tracking and gesture recognition. 
You can find my blogpost [here](https://www.christophpacher.com/blog/diploma-project-masskerade/) or see it in action on [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/143922328)

This code is not clean or perfectly documented. 
The tracker is not standalone. It should be separted from the game via a nice network interface. One of many Todos, like finishing the intergration of the Kinect V2. 
If you need help setting up the external libs, contact me.
